                <h4>Weather During Autumn In Queensland</h4>
                <p align="justify">
                    As mentioned before, Queensland during the autumn time is not just known around for
                    its festivals and activities but the overall autumn colors in Queensland are what make

                <p align="justify">    
                    The temperature usually drops down to 15-25 degrees centigrade which is pretty standard 
                    for the autumn weather. Not only is it amazing and pleasant for you to step out of the
                    house to enjoy the tropical weather but the rain is a bare minimum during that time
                    which is an added bonus.

                 <h4>Things To Do In Queensland In Autumn</h4>
                 <p align="justify">
                    Now, it should be very well known that surfing and Australia are synonymous. The continent
                    is famous globally for the same and The Quiksilver Pro and Roxy Pro Gold Coast is a
                    must-attend event for all the surfers that visit Queensland during the autumn months.

                 </p>

                 <blockquote>
                    The Mackay City Auto Group North Queensland Games is definitely something worth visiting
                    Queensland for during the autumn months. Majority of the tourists are going to visit
                    Queensland for just the sightseeing spots around and while that’s okay, if you are visiting
                    around in Autumn, it would be an absolute shame if you miss out on some of the 
                    most popular events around.

                 </blockquote>

                 <h4>The Targerts</h4>
                 <p align="justify">
                    One of the most amazing events that Queensland hosts during the autumn months is
                    Beef Australia. Just as the name suggests, the event specializes in showcasing
                    some of the best beef and briskets around from Australia.
                 </p>
                 <p align="justify">
                    As odd as it might sound, Queensland does celebrate the landing of Lieutenant James Cook
                    into Bustard Bay at 1770 on 24 May. The festival is not just about the legend himself but 
                    has become symbolic of the amazing community that comes around to celebrate it every year around.
